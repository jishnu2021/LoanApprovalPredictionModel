# LoanApprovalPredictionModel
This repository contains a machine learning model implemented in Python using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The aim of this project is to predict loan approval status based on various features provided in the dataset.


# Features
 LabelEncoder: Used for encoding categorical variables into numerical format, which is necessary for many machine learning algorithms.
 StandardScaler: Employed to scale features to a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, ensuring uniformity in feature magnitudes.
 RandomForestClassifier: A powerful ensemble learning method used for classification tasks, employing multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting.
 GaussianNB: Naive Bayes classifier particularly suitable for classification tasks with continuous features, based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features.
 DecisionTreeClassifier: A tree-based algorithm that recursively splits the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attribute, resulting in a tree-like structure useful for 
 classification.
 KNeighborsClassifier: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression tasks, assigning labels to data points based on the majority label of their k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.
